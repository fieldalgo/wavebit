# Spectral fitting and normal-field resolution

| Entry | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `nvf_fitting_grid.py` | How far do four fitted dimensions move when the normal-field grid changes, with the target and Fourier order held fixed? |

The runnable workflow is documented in
[the fitting guide](../../../docs/guide/rcwa/fitting-grid-convergence.md).
The study uses JAX forward differentiation and NumPy/SciPy fitting; it runs on CPU
and can take substantially longer than the small example. Output is a new JSON
file chosen by `--output`; exit code 2 preserves an unconverged result.

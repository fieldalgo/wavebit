"""The bodies: a signed distance, its gradient, and the closed forms each one happens to own.

A **body** is the smoothed, differentiable thing stage 4 adds, and it is not the same object as
a ``Shape`` in ``wavebit/fd/geometry.py``. A ``Slab`` or a ``Box`` there is cell-snapped and
answers questions about *cell indices* -- which cells it fills, which it may touch, whether it
is uniform across a layer. A body answers questions about a *point*: how far is your surface
from here, which way does it face, and -- where it can do better than a plane -- exactly how
much of this voxel do you fill. The two meet in C2, which is the only place that will know both.

Every body answers three things:

``surface(points) -> (d, n)``
    ``d`` negative inside, and ``n`` the **unit** outward normal, unit *everywhere* including
    at the points where the true gradient does not exist (a sphere's centre, a box's medial
    axis, a polygon's vertex). That is a contract ``_cut.cut_parts`` depends on: it divides by
    ``max_i |n_i| dx``, which is at least ``dx/sqrt(3)`` for a unit vector and zero for a zero
    one. Where the gradient is genuinely undefined the body names the direction it returns; the
    fill there is 0 or 1 whatever the direction is, so the choice cannot be observed.

``exact_fill(points, dx) -> fill | None``
    The exact filled fraction where a closed form is free, ``None`` otherwise -- and ``None``
    is the *common* case, which is why the plane exists.

``exact_moment(points, dx) -> (area, moment) | None``
    The exact interface area in the voxel and ``area * n_c^2`` over it. Separate from
    ``exact_fill`` because the two are not free together: a cylinder's fill is a closed form
    the repository already owns and its curved side's second moment is not.

**Where the exact forms are, and where they are not**

    body                fill                              moment
    Box, Prism          polygon-box clip x 1-D overlap    edge moments x overlap + cap areas
    Cylinder            disc-box clip x 1-D overlap       *tangent plane*
    Sphere              *tangent plane*                   *tangent plane*
    Union/Intersection/
    Difference          *tangent plane*                   *tangent plane*

A cylinder's exact moment would need the second moment of the arc of a circle clipped to a
rectangle -- the angular interval set, not the area -- and the repository owns no such form;
the arc-weighted *area* forms it does own (``_weighted_circle_area``) are a bilinear window for
a different geometry. Measured cost of using the plane's moment there instead of the truth,
against 20001-point quadrature over the true circumference
(``tests/test_fd_shapes.py::test_the_plane_is_the_cylinders_moment_and_this_is_what_that_costs``,
cut voxels only, worst ``|w - w_exact|`` then rms):

    R/h          away from the rim              on the rim
      4        1.31e-2   9.63e-3            3.98e-1   2.04e-1
      8        1.92e-2   1.02e-2            5.09e-1   2.35e-1
     16        7.19e-3   3.50e-3            5.18e-1   1.68e-1

Away from the rim the plane's normal *is* the true normal at the nearest point and the error is
the arc's own spread, falling. **On the rim it does not converge at all.** A rim is a crease,
and the plane sees exactly one surface where the voxel holds two. The stage-4 design's section
3 says a creased two-media interface is "handled exactly by the ``exact_fill``/moment forms";
for a cylinder's cap rim that is not true as this table stands, and it is C2's to decide
whether to write the clipped arc's second moment or to record the price beside the rule.

**Sphere has no exact fill, and the reason is not the one either side of study S3(a) gave.**
S3(a) decided stage 4 would not write one, on the grounds that the shapes with exact forms are
the ones the plane serves worst; its review inverted that to "at equal resolution the sphere is
the worst of the four". Re-measured here with both sweeps on one length axis, neither survives:
at equal cells across, the sphere reads ``1.000 (h/D)^2`` and the rotated box, the CSG box and
the hexagonal prism read 0.81 to 1.16, and only the sphere's constant is stable (three readings
within 0.0013 against the others' 0.35, because a polyhedron's plane error lives on its edges,
whose voxel count the sub-cell offset moves). The decision still stands and this file keeps it,
for the reason that does survive: **the bias is second order and one-signed**, so the
convergence study that is the gate fits it away, and the alternative is a quadrature per voxel
where the other three bodies have a closed form. The constant therefore belongs in a docstring
rather than in the code, which is where it is (``_cut.py``).
